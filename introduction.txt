Hi, Iâ€™m Rashika Seth, second year student pusuing B.Tech.
I have recently joined this society and I am excited to be a part of it.
Currently, I am learning Git, GitHub, and web development (HTML, CSS, Java).
I enjoy exploring new technologies and building small projects to practice my skills.
Through this society, I hope to connect with like-minded people and grow together.
Looking forward to contributing and learning with everyone here!
Coming to my hobbies I like playing badminton, reading books, drawing, and listening to some music to unwind myself.
My skills include Web development, I m currently doing DSA using java as well.
